# Voice IME 2.0.1 Acceptance

## Basic Input

1. Run `启动语音输入.bat` from the portable root.
2. The main GUI window appears.
3. The input-level meter appears in the main input view and moves when speaking into the selected microphone.
4. Click the large microphone button or press `Alt+R` to start recording.
5. Speak a short Chinese sentence.
6. Click the stop button or press `Alt+R` again to stop.
7. Text appears in the overlay or main confirmation editor.
8. Confirm input pastes into the focused target and does not send.

## Audio Device

1. Open Settings / Voice.
2. The microphone select lists system default and enumerated input devices.
3. Pick a non-default microphone, save settings, and restart the app.
4. The chosen microphone remains selected and recording uses that device.
5. The meter reports peak/rms/sample-rate values without starting a full recording.

## Smart Edit

1. Put `这个判断很准，输入法的边界就是不要替我说话。` in the editor.
2. Record `帮我改得更正式一点`.
3. If MiniCPM is reachable, the existing text is rewritten.
4. If MiniCPM is unavailable, the original editor text is retained.

## Long Transcript

1. Record longer than `long_transcript_seconds`.
2. If Settings / Data / long recording retention is enabled, audio is copied to `.voice_ime/recordings`.
3. Status shows segmented long transcription progress.
4. Clear cancels the current session and stale results cannot overwrite the next session.

## Retention

1. Open Settings / Data.
2. `短录音留存` is shown as disabled and `永不保存`.
3. Set `长录音留存` to `不保存`, save settings, and complete a long transcription.
4. The long transcription still produces text, but no new long-recording file is kept.
5. Click `清理录音`; existing audio files directly under `.voice_ime/recordings` are removed.

## Package

1. Portable root visibly contains one user-facing file: `启动语音输入.bat`.
2. Runtime `.voice_ime` data is not included in the release.
3. Hidden `app` folder contains `VoiceIME.exe`, `BUILD.txt`, README, acceptance notes, 2.0.1 roadmap, optional local model/runtime folders, and bundled Tauri frontend resources inside the exe.
4. Packaging fails if the portable root contains unexpected visible files, `.voice_ime`, `recordings`, `backup`, or `backups` directories.
5. Core package `app/models` contains only `MODELS.json` and `MODELS.md`.

## History Export

1. Complete at least one transcription so History has a row.
2. Open History and click `导出 CSV`.
3. A `history-export-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.csv` file appears under `.voice_ime/logs`.
4. The CSV includes final text, raw ASR, deterministic stages, LLM text, backend, model, session id, and timing columns.
5. Text that starts with spreadsheet formula trigger characters is exported safely for table tools.

## Diagnostics Panel

1. Open Settings / Data and click `诊断`.
2. A diagnostics panel appears in the page with pass, warning, or failure rows.
3. The rows cover app/log paths, microphone, clipboard, ASR models, smart-correction endpoint, translation backend, prompt, correction table, hotwords, and hot rules.
4. A `doctor-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt` report path is shown in the panel and the file exists under `.voice_ime/logs`.
5. Clicking `导出` still creates the support zip and includes the latest doctor output without including recordings or model binaries.

## Current 2.0.1 Test Boundary

- Automated regression covers Rust unit tests, Rust compile, clippy, frontend build, release build, and portable packaging.
- Startup smoke test covers that `VoiceIME.exe` stays alive for 5 seconds after launch instead of panicking before GUI startup. Smoke tests must use a temporary `VOICE_IME_APP_DIR` so they do not write `.voice_ime` into the portable package.
- ASR smoke now covers `balanced`, `fast`, and `fallback` as worker subprocesses. If sherpa-onnx exits badly, the GUI should show an error instead of closing.
- Empty ASR output must not call MiniCPM; prompt-like MiniCPM output containing "个人词表", "纠错表", or "ASR 文本" must be discarded.
- Translation must translate the current editor text only; prompt-like translation output must be discarded.
- Portable release must not open a console window for `VoiceIME.exe`; local llama-server is launched hidden.
- Manual Windows integration still needs a real pass on Notepad, WeChat/Feishu, Chrome, Word/document editors, and IDE input boxes.
- Real ASR acceptance requires sherpa-onnx model files matching the 2.0.1 default config. The copied 1.1.5 `faster-whisper-small` folder is reference material only and does not satisfy the new sherpa-onnx model paths.
- Each missing model row in Settings has clickable download, mirror page, official page, and model-folder actions. The downloader tries `hf-mirror.com` first, then `huggingface.co`.
- Settings shows download progress/failure in an in-panel notice, not only in the title status chip.
- Settings / Voice now exposes microphone selection and the main input view shows a pre-recording input meter; real multi-device manual coverage is still required on the target machines.
- History CSV export is automated and unit-tested for escaping; real spreadsheet review still depends on manual sample data from target machines.
- Long recording retention can be disabled and existing long recordings can be cleared from Settings / Data; short recordings remain non-retained by design.
- Portable packaging now includes an automated layout/release gate and `BUILD.txt`; manual smoke is still useful after packaging because it proves WebView startup on this machine.
- Settings / Data now shows an inline diagnostics panel after running Doctor; one-click repair actions are still future work.
